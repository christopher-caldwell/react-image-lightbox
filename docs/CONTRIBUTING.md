**WIP**

After cloning the repository and running `npm install` inside, you can use the following commands to develop and build the project.

```sh
# Starts a webpack dev server that hosts a demo page with the lightbox.
# It uses react-hot-loader so changes are reflected on save.
npm start

# Lints the code with eslint and my custom rules.
yarn run lint

# Lints and builds the code, placing the result in the dist directory.
# This build is necessary to reflect changes if you're
#  `npm link`-ed to this repository from another local project.
yarn run build
```

Pull requests are welcome!
